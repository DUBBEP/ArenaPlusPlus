# Move++
Create a custom arena for the HeroBorn game
 
The jump has been refined. Pickups will respawn after being collected. Enemies will follow patrol routes, and attack the player when they get close. If the player collides with an enemy 1 health point will be deducted and they will be knocked backwards (only if they are facing the enemy). The player will lose if their health reaches zero or they fall off of the arena. Enemies can be defeated and will flash when injured. 

Controls
